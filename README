Project Overview

This project performs a statistical analysis of business sales data to understand sales behavior, marketing impact, and revenue patterns.
The analysis uses descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, confidence intervals, and regression modeling to generate meaningful business insights.

This project demonstrates how statistics can support data-driven decision making in real-world business scenarios.

🎯 Project Objectives

📊 Dataset Description

File: business_data.csv

Column Name	Description
Sales	Total sales revenue
Marketing_Spend	Marketing expenditure
Profit	Net profit
🔍 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation

Helps understand central tendency and spread of sales data

2️⃣ Distribution Analysis

Histogram of sales

Normality testing using Shapiro-Wilk test

3️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation between Sales and Marketing Spend

Correlation heatmap for numeric variables

4️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

One-sample t-test

Independent t-test

ANOVA test

Results are stored in hypothesis_tests_results.txt.

5️⃣ Confidence Interval

95% confidence interval calculated for average sales

6️⃣ Regression Analysis

Linear regression to predict sales based on marketing spend

R-squared used to measure model performance

📈 Sample Output
Average Sales: $45,200 ± $3,400 (95% CI)
Correlation (Sales-Marketing): 0.78 (Strong)
Marketing affects sales: p = 0.0012 ✓ Significant

▶️ How to Run the Project

💡 Key Business Insights

Marketing spend has a strong positive impact on sales

Sales data follows a near-normal distribution

Regression analysis confirms marketing as a key sales driver

Statistical tests validate business assumptions with confidence

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how statistical methods can be applied to real business data to support informed decision-making.
The analysis framework can be extended to larger datasets or used in predictive business models.
